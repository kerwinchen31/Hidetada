**Description**

Our final project is to use processing to create the game Bomb-It, but instead of bombs we use vegetables! The goal of the game is to be the last one standing. There will be at most up to two players in the game.

At the beginning of the game, 4 characters spawn on the four corners of the map, with 2 or 3 of the characters being machines depending on how many players are playing.
Throughout the game, the user(s) will interact with the map by placing vegetables that explode. The goal is to eliminate the other players or machines and be the last one standing. The starting vegetable is a cabbage which has the smallest blast radius. Throughout the map there will be various power ups such as a shield, a 1-Up, and various vegetable upgrades. Each character starts with 3 hearts.

There will be two modes. The first mode is a deathmatch and the second one is a timed game. In the timed game if multiple people are alive than the character with the most coins collected is the winner (coins will be randomly generated and found on the map).

**Launch Instructions**

After you launch Game.pde in processing, a game screen will appear, prompting the user to enter a for the 1-player mode and b for the 2-player mode. Then, the game will prompt user(s) to enter a number from 0-9 corresponding to a color displayed on the screen to choose a color for each player.

In 1-player mode, user will use the keys W, A, S, D to move up, left, down, right one unit respectively and F to drop an exploding vegetable. In 2- player mode, player 1 will use the keys W, A, S, D, F, while player 2 will use the the keys I, J, K, L to move up, left, down, right one unit and the backspace or delete key to drop an exploding vegetable. Each character starts with 3 hearts. It's the survival of the fittest, so drop a veggie on the other players before they drop one on you!
