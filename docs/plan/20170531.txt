==============================================================

We are recreating a multiplayer game called Bomb It, where players control 
keys to navigate a maze, set bombs to blow-up removable walls, and beating 
other players by placing a bomb within their range, potentially the use of 
power-ups. Our version, the Attack on the Vegetables, utilizes processing 
to materialize a simplied version of Bomb It.

We will have one overlaying processing file called game, which operates the
actual game (the Driver file). Then we will create different player files 
and bomb files.
